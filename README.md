## Prerequisites

To run `fdf`, you are going to need the `Minilibx` library.

This is included with the project and set to use that by default. Don't mind the errors!

If you are a 42 student and wish to run this via the internal MLX, please update the Makefile and fdf.h accordingly.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tikanoja/FdF fdf && cd fdf && make
```

Do not mind the errors, the MLX library is just very verbose heh!

## Usage

Cd to the installation location and execute with the path to the .fdf file as an argument.

```bash
./fdf test_maps/t2.fdf
```
